# Sensors

On day 3 we looked at an example how to receive motion sensor data from Android phones, Arduino microcontrollers and a Polar HR sensor.

## Android app (Sensor2OSC)

The Android app can send phone sensor data and also connect to Polar HR sensor.

[v0.1.0 debug APK](app-debug.apk)

## SensorVisualizer app

The SensorVisualizer (Processing) app is run on a computer and receives and visualizes the received sensor data.

The SensorVisualizer repository also includes Arduino (M5StickC) code for sending motion sensor data.
